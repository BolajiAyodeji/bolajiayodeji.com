Web App date 20190401T1322142400 draft false type post tags javascript PWA web apps httpscdnimages1mediumcommax80015MB2BgLFKmsLfgNCwli4EApng Progressive Web Apps are very much in use by some of the biggest companies like Twitter Forbes Alibaba Instagram Flipkart etc and have gained popularity Building a PWA is quite easy and simple In this tutorial were going to build a simple Progressive web app A weight converter app Lets roll TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Starter files App description Building the UI Add JavaScript Functionality Build the Progressive Web App Deploy to Netlify Conclusion INTRODUCTION Im sure by now you must have heard or read about Progressive Web Applications Progressive Web Applications are experiences that combine the best of web applications features and the best of mobile applications features They use service workers HTTPS a manifest file and an app shell architecture to deliver native app experiences to web applications The term Progressive Web Apps was first coined by Frances Berrimanhttpstwittercomphae and Alex Russellhttpstwittercomslightlylate in 2015 as a way of describing applications that take advantage of new features supported by modern browsers including service workers and web app manifests Progressive Web Apps are largely characterized by the following Reliable They load instantly and never show the No Internet Connection page even in uncertain network conditions with help from Service workers caching Fast They respond quickly to user interactions with smooth animations Engaging They feel like a natural app on the device with immersive user experience WHY BUILD PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS Building a highquality Progressive Web App has incredible benefits making it easy to delight your users grow engagement and increase traffic Theyre installable if a user visits your website for the second third or fourth time they get the option of adding it to their home screen Desktop Android or iOS After that it works like a mobile application Theyre indexable your app is visible in the browsers and so its searchable for users They work offline once you download it to your device you can cache contents from the app without an Internet connection Your users will never see the running downasaur They can send push notifications once a new articleproductpiece of news shows up on your website your users will be notified just like every mobile app out there They cut down page load times as proved by housingcomhttpsdevelopersgooglecomwebshowcase2016pdfshousingpdf PWAs can significantly reduce page load times and thus improve overall UX They are progressive They will work for any user on any device even with a poor internet connection THE THREE BASIC CRITERIA FOR A PWA 1 You need to be running on HTTPS 1 You need a web manifest 1 You need a service worker Heres a video from Google IO 17 that explains in depth about Progressive Web Apps Learn how PWAs huge reach low friction high reengagement and lower costs work for developers and businesses This talk details new ways of building and distributing Progressive Web Apps on Android and other OSes that let you reach more users STARTER FILES You can find the starter repository herehttpsgithubcomBolajiAyodejiweightconverter with all files and final demo herehttpsbolajiwcnetlifycom APP DESCRIPTION Were going to build a simple weight converter that converts a given weight from Pounds to its equivalent in Gram Kilogram and Ounce This project is just to help you understand how PWAs work after this you can build your own project Wed use Bootstrap 4 for the UI and JavaScript for the main functionality Heres how the final project looks httpscdnimages1mediumcommax6001J5fWtuatiYG7u7711rApng httpscdnimages1mediumcommax60019MwTrHHOVXTVqmVofQdXCgpng BUILDING THE UI Now lets build the User interface of our application First create the following files indexhtml cssappcss jsappjs imgfaviconpng Use any png image Now lets build the markup In indexhtml add this Weve added some Bootstrap classes already in indexhtml but we have not included Bootstrap CDN yet In appcss were going to do that Add this in cssappcss Now your app should look like this httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001dVU0ojt4fRoxPsIFyVobfwpng ADD JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONALITY Basically we want to get the input value from the input field and process then return results to each of the following ids gOutput for Grams kgOutput for Kilogram ozOutput for Ounces In indexhtml we wrapped all this ids in output We also want to hide the results and display after a user enters a value in the input field Here is how we convert weight from Pounds to its equivalent in Gram Kilogram and Ounce 1 Gram Pounds 00022046 1 Kilogram Pounds 22046 1 Ounce Pounds 16 Add this in jsappjs This is just basic JavaScript if you have no idea what all this means you should get JavaScript Teacherhttpsmediumcomu6727c1eb71f8s Grammar JavaScript book This will teach you all the basics and contents of Modern JavaScript Get a free copy herehttpjavascriptgrammarcom Now you should have a functioning app httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001h2u8Y76VSqkARDDujoz5Qpng BUILD THE PROGRESSIVE WEB APP The three basic criteria for a PWA Service worker A service worker is a script that allows your browser to run in the background separate from a web page opening the door to features that dont need a web page or user interaction Today they already include features like push notifications and background sync Read morehttpsdevelopersgooglecomwebfundamentalsprimersserviceworkers Manifest file The web app manifest is a simple JSON file that tells the browser about your web application and how it should behave when installed on the users mobile device or desktop Having a manifest is required by Chrome to show the Add to Home Screen prompt Read morehttpsdevelopersgooglecomwebfundamentalswebappmanifest Icons This icons control your application and are provided in different sizes for different devices Your PWA app will not work without them Now lets get started Before we proceed ensure youre using a live server Use Web server for Chromehttpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailwebserverforchromeofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigbhlen or VSCode Live ServerhttpsmarketplacevisualstudiocomitemsitemNameritwickdeyLiveServer Create the following files swjs In root directory manifestjson In root directory imgicons Where wed store our icons First we need to check if the browser supports service workers and register a new one In jsappjs add if serviceWorker in navigator windowaddEventListenerload navigatorserviceWorkerregisterswjsthen consolelogService Worker Registered If the browser supports it you should get this in your console httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001TSVpFT5aDstfLbi2sOP6gpng httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001xFmG989w4GbNJesCTpUzHQpng Your final appjs should look like this Were going to use the Workboxhttpsdevelopersgooglecomwebtoolsworkbox library to power our service worker Workbox is a set of libraries and Node modules developed by Google that make it easy to cache assets and take full advantage of features used to build Progressive Web Apps The idea of our service worker is to cache all files Fonts JavaScript CSS Images etc so we can access them offline after the page loads The important thing to understand about the Service Worker is that you are in control of the network You get to decide what is cached how it is cached and how it should be returned to the user In swjs add this So basically we imported workboxswjs which is Workboxs service worker file then we checked if Workbox is loaded in our own service worker if workbox consolelogYay Workbox is loaded else consolelogBoo Workbox didnt load One of Workboxs primary features is its routing and caching strategy modules It allows you to listen for requests from your web page and determine if and how that request should be cached and responded to Routing in Workbox is the process of a Router matching a request to a route and the route then handling that request ie providing a response In swjs we did something like this workboxroutingregisterRoute jscssscss new workboxstrategiesStaleWhileRevalidate Basically this tells Workbox that when a request is made it should see if the regular expression matches part of the URL css scss js and if it does cache that file The StaleWhileRevalidate function allows us to use this cache in our application but still update in the background if the file has changed You would need to refresh again to see the new files Precaching a file will ensure that a file is downloaded and cached before a service worker is installed meaning that if your service worker is installed your files will be cacheds httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001iwVOXzY8RmmEIIj5qkpTwpng Now our service worker works and would cache files once the page loads Now lets make our app installable Add this in manifestjson Your PWA Icons sizes should be in px and in the following sizes 72x72 96x96 128x128 144x144 152x152 192x192 384x384 512x512 You can use the Web Manifest Generatorhttpsappmanifestfirebaseappcom to generate your manifestjson httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001CdXaaSSg8Oc5OaTe1lnPFApng Now we need to connect our web app to the manifest to allow add to home screen from that page Add this to your indexhtml If you have multiple pages you need to add this to all of them You can also use the same themecolor you used in manifestjson here Now your final indexhtml should look like this PS Ive added some SEO tags Now caching will begin once the page loads httpscdnimages1mediumcommax80011dVXSr5lmoaiTo5s9JMEApng Congratulations youve successfully built your first Progressive Web App It can be installed on Mobile Android and iOS and Desktop DESKTOP httpscdnimages1mediumcommax6001U8CZYQgPl2xHAJ95gs4qQpng

from the user for further processing httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8000CGoiWT8KU7KSGuIpng Most times forms are just used to receive input that requires no processing but rather just receiving data this might be a contact form RSVP get a quote etc Traditionally forms are managed with the help of a server also known as server side but this is more efficient when youre processing the data from the form maybe a user registration form where the form data is validated authenticated and saved in a database When youre building a simple form where youre only receiving data from the user and not processing ie contact form the goal is to get the data from the form and send to your company support email eg info support Using a server here is not ideal and is only an overkill a very common way of doing this is via PHPMailerhttpsgithubcomPHPMailerPHPMailer The classic email sending library for PHP PHPMailer is used with PHP and requires a lot of boring server configurations What if youre just building a static site There should be an easier way of doing this client side right In this article Ill introduce you to two methods of handling form data client side in static sites There are other methods but Ive used these two and considered them to be the best and easiest no hard feelings NO hectic configurations NO servers NO serious stuff just build your form do some little tweaks the user submits and bingo it heads straight to your designated email STARTER FORM For the purpose of this article Ive built a basic form with HTML5 and Bootstrap 4 you can fork it from the Codepen belowhttpscodepenioiambolajiayopenMdGdex pen idMdGdex Currently this form uses none of the methods well talk about at the end of the article Ill provide the full code for both methods you can then update the form and test Ive added a little validation dont worry about that Now lets get started METHOD ONE httpscdnimages1mediumcommax80007DZwsHAjwcTxTzfR Formspreehttpformspreeio provides functional HTML forms via their platform with no PHP or JavaScript Send your form to their URL and itll be forwarded to your email No PHP Javascript or sign up required perfect for static sites Wait wait wait its Open Sourcedhttpsgithubcomformspreeformspree too Form handling with Formspree Build your form weve done that alreadyhttpscodepenioiambolajiayopenMdGdexeditors1010 Follow the next step and update this form to use this method Now lets go over the new stuff added above We changed the forms actionattribute to httpsformspreeioyouemailcom replace youremailcommailtoyouremailcom with your own email This is simply sending your form data to formspree then to your email Formspree is acting as a third party here Ive added some name attributes to the input fields This is just configuring each field so we can grab the data and send to formspree For Email address I added a replyto attribute This just mean youll be able to quickly reply to the user who originally submitted via email Ive added a subject attribute This value is used for the emails subject so that you can quickly reply to submissions without having to edit the subject line each time Ive added a next attribute By default after submitting a form the user is shown the Formspree Thank You page You can provide an alternative URL for that page like so httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001M2O2tR08URl1I2i5bVGU5Qpng formspree default success page httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001nLA5m3yjx4mmmJAmuu8Ygpng custom success page I built for a client We added a value attribute to the send button valueSend This is our Thanos one snap at this button and your form is erased and its data sent to your email httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001lura6hCCGs8w5UhtwdIIApng httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001hnEhoz4pSb4pNtzXD0pDpwpng Thats all to using formspree Although there are other configuration settings for several other features you can check herehttpsformspreeio Things to note You dont need to signup to use formspree just add your action attribute and youre good to go You only signup if you want a Paid planhttpsformspreeioplans Make sure your form has the methodPOST attribute Formspree uses reCAPTCHA to identify spam submissions After a user clicks our Thanos theyll have to do some CAPTCHA verification Cool way of stopping spam submissions httpscdnimages1mediumcommax80010mq3GFJ4fRWnR5vX1L5gpng After that the form is sent to your designated email and the custom success page is displayed Formspree does not read your form data they have no access to it theyre just a delivery service you send your parcel sealed to them they deliver to your customer cool right Formspree is free for 50 submissions per form per month ONLY Need more you can upgrade to the Paid planhttpsformspreeioplans Formspree has both Free and Paid plans Paid plans have several other features like admin dashboard unlimited submissions AJAX handling etc Paid plans and their features can be found herehttpsformspreeioplans httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001UZwPE17ZnWZym5qaDkYIwApng If youre building a basic site you shouldnt worry about Paid plans Paid plans are mostly needed by Enterprise applications and companies the Free plan would cover all your needs I use this for some client projects too Formspree premium users can submit forms via AJAX Just set the Accept header to applicationjson If youre using jQuery this can be done like so ajax url httpsformspreeioFORMID method POST data message hello dataType json Well this is for paid users If you dont use jQUERY like me and youre tired of the lengthy AJAX default syntax check out simpleAJAX libraryhttpsgithubcomBolajiAyodejisimpleajaxlibrary a simple library I built for handling HTTP requests Like so const http new simpleAJAX const data name Bolaji Ayodeji email hibolajiayodejicom message hi httpposthttpsformspreeioFORMID data err user iferr consolelogerr else consoleloguser A star would make me happy METHOD TWO

Deployment Lambda Functions Split Testing Preview Branches and more Now that you have deployed your site lets create the form again Now lets go over the new stuff I added above Netlify is quite easier you simply add the netlify attribute datanetlifytrueto the tag and you can start receiving submissions in your Netlify site admin panel Here the action attribute serves as your custom success page Thats all your form submissions goes straight to your Netlify admin panel Settings Build deploy Environment Environment variables Watch the video above if you dont understand what the panel means Things to note Your site must be hosted on netlify to use this method You must add the netlify attribute for the form to work You can find all submissions to your Netlify forms in the Forms tab of your site dashboard Settings Forms Netlify has free and paid plans too httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001sg2Fo1r5gniCilQjBcMhApng httpswwwnetlifycompricinghttpswwwnetlifycompricingfeatures Netlify has

sent from teamnetlifycom and any replies to a notification will go to that address If you would like to respond to a form submitter you will need to enter their address manually Netlify Forms can receive files uploads via form submissions too To do this add an input with typefile to any form When a form is submitted a link to each uploaded file will be included in the form submission details Netlify is limited to 100 submissions per month and 10MB uploads per month for the FREE plan If you want more youll need to upgrade httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001XaWaJiI6eQq06ogPEHUgpng form submissions in the admin panel And thats all Final HTML Form code Conclusion One thing to note about formspree is that the free version leaves your email address exposed to scrapers and bots so you might want to set up a temporary disposable email address while you use it If you want to hide your email address by default youll need to upgrade your plan Do you want extra practice Watch this

title How to build a simple Progressive Web App with PWAFire and Deploy to GitHub Pages and Firebase date 20181126T1322142400 draft false type post tags javascript pwa service workers Recently I discovered a new trend a powerful web technology one that every Web Developer should know yeah I said every I first heard about PWAs few months back and at first it was weird trying to understand the concept and then trying to learn it I stumbled on a link that led me to PWAFirehttpsgithubcommayeedwinpwafire an Open Sourced framework that helps you to Build Scalable Progressive Web AppsFirst Experiences I started out by reading what PWA really mean and why I should learn it After understanding the entire concept I decided to dive in As a Developer one skill you should possess is Learning What you knew yesterday might be obsolete today It happens on the web from time to time that powerful technologies come to exist if you are still behind youd miss out on this evolution So you should have heard of PWA or Progressive Web Apps and you probably might be wondering what this really means Basically a Progressive Web App is a mobile website that can perform superfast and behave just like a mobile app A Progressive Web App PWA is a web app that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an applike experience to users Now lets break this down Lets break the word Progressive Web App Progressive happening or developing gradually or in stages Web A common name for the World Wide Web a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser App An application especially as downloaded by a user to a mobile device Lets merge all this definition a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser happening or developing gradually or in stages and can be downloaded by a user to a mobile device To wrap up A progressive Web App is a modern web application built with a number of specific technologies and standard patterns which allow them to take advantage of both web and native app features PWA helps us to build Crossplatform web apps Works on the web Android iOS and Desktop Progressive Web Apps are installable and live on a users home screen without the need for an app store They offer an immersive full screen experience with help from a web app manifest file and can even reengage users with web push notifications What does a Progressive Web App Looks Like When you visit a website with PWA It pops up with a notification telling you to add the website to your homescreen This is just like downloading an app from the App Store or Play Store I would be showing you shots from NettyFinderhttpnettyfinderherokuappcom a little project I built you can contribute herehttpsgithubcomBolajiAyodejinettyfinder httpscdnimages1mediumcommax88008DOrNvYwXwEzhOw Once youve clicked ADD the website is then installed on your device and yes it acts like a mobile app httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8800UhbmvAiQyPXNiBIC You can uninstall it and share it basically you use it like a normal Mobile App Cool right PWAs can also be installed on Android iOS and Desktop Heres how it looks on Desktop httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8801ItX86SzE0hFhPyfhHksn5gpng Why build a Progressive Web App So why should you build a PWA Building a highquality Progressive Web App has incredible benefits making it easy to delight your users grow engagement and increase traffic theyre installable if a user visits your website for the second third or fourth time they get the option of adding it to their home screen After that its still linkable and therefore shareable via URL theyre indexable your app is visible in the browsers and so its searchable for users they work offline once you download it to your device you can cache contents from the app without an Internet connection Your users will never see the running downasaur they can send push notifications once a new articleproductpiece of news shows up on your website your users will be notified just like every mobile app out there they cut down page load times as proved by housingcomhttpsdevelopersgooglecomwebshowcase2016pdfshousingpdf PWAs can significantly reduce page load times and thus improve overall UX theyre progressive they will work for any user on any device even with a poor Internet connection The benefits of Progressive Web Apps are enormous you can check more on Google Developers Docshttpsdevelopersgooglecomwebprogressivewebapps The three basic criteria for a PWA The three baseline criteria a website must fulfil in order to qualify as a Progressive Web App are You need to be running under HTTPS You need a Web App Manifest You need a Service Worker Now lets move to the Codelab section Codelab Flow What we shall do in this codelab Download Demo Project Starter guide Setup Service Worker Setup Web Manifest Configure Service Worker Configure

paste this code to the index file just before the end of the body tag or in the head tag NB YOU NEED HTTPS We are going to use Firebase Hostinghttpsfirebasegooglecomdocshostingdeployingsectionhostingsetup and GitHub Pageshttpspagesgithubcom later which shall have HTTPS already provisioned for our project First we need to check if the browser supports service workers and if it does register the service worker if serviceWorker in navigator windowaddEventListenerload function navigatorserviceWorkerregisterserviceworkerjs thenfunction consolelogService Worker Registered Cheers to PWA Fire Setup Web Manifest We are going to add a link tag to all the pages that encompass our web app inside the head tag For our case we only have one page the indexhtml Add the following code to it Configure Service Worker serviceworkerjs A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background separate from a web page opening the door to features that dont need a web page or user interaction NOTE The important thing to understand about the Service Worker is that you are in control of the network You get to decide what is cached how it is cached and how it should be returned to the user Follow the steps in the code below configure to your desired taste PWA Fire Bundle after a service worker is installed and the user navigates to a different page or refreshesthe service worker will begin to receive fetch events selfaddEventListenerfetch functionevent eventrespondWithcachesopencachethenfunctioncache return

mysql database When many developers refer to a database they are usually referring to MySQL a very popular DBMS that powers projects of all sizes The USP of MySQL is its ability to handle huge volumes of data without breaking a sweat In this article I will discuss how to connect MySQL Database using Localhost Server Create MySQL Database at the Localhost First let me tell you what PHPMyAdmin is It is a control panel from where you can manage your database that you have created Open your browser and go to localhostPHPMyAdmin or click Admin in XAMPP UI When you first installed XAMPP it only created the username for it to be accessed you now have to add a password to it by yourself For this you have to go to User account where the user is same as the one shown in this picture httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8800Kjc5Hwt0tHeDZJEpng Now click Edit privileges and go to Change Admin password type your password there and save it Remember this password as it will be use to connect to your Database httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8800Bf6g12KPGGtGDHuSpng Note It is not necessary to change password to access databases on local host It is a good practice and that is why we have used a password Create Database Now return to the homepage of phpmyadmin Click New button to create a new database httpscdnimages1mediumcommax88007IUxi9DeitEReIyapng In the new window name your database as per your need I am naming it practice Now select Collation as utf8generalci as we are using it for learning purposes and it will handle all of our queries and data that will be covered in this tutorial series Now click on Create and your database will be created httpscdnimages1mediumcommax88002Cysb8IhDpvzDuQ7png The newly created database will be empty now as there are no tables in it I will be covering that in the upcoming series where we will learn how to create tables and insert data in it In this tutorial we are going to connect this database to a localhost using PHP httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8800zjlRKjiDUjimMy7qpng Create a Folder in htdocs Now locate the folder where you installed XAMPP and open htdocs folder usually cxampp Create a new folder inside cxampphtdocs and name it practice we will place web files in this folder Why we have created folder in htdocs XAMPP uses folders in htdocs to execute and run your PHP sites Note If your using WAMP then add your practice folder in cwampwww folder Create Database Connection File In PHP Create a new php file and name it dbconnnectionphp and save it Why am I creating a separate database connection file Because if you have created multiple files in which you want to insert data or select data from the databases you dont need to write the code for database connection every time You just have to include it by using PHP custom function include include connectionphp on the top of your code and call its function and use it It also helps when you are moving your project location from one PC to another and you have to change the values on the single file and all the changes will be applied to all the other files automatically Write the following code in your dbconnection file error return conn function CloseConconn conn close Here is the explanation of the variable that we have used in our dbconnection file 1 dbhost will be the host where your server is running it is usually localhost 1 dbuser will be the username ie root and dbpass will be the password which is the same that you used to access your phpmyadmin 1 dbname will be the name of your database which we have created in this

developers we need to be familiar with this status codes In this article Id be explaining what each HTTP status code stand for What is an HTTP status code For every request from a web browser the server responds with a status code If there was a error you can get additional information about the error You can find the most frequent error codes and a brief description in the list below HTTP Error 401 Unauthorized The 401 status code indicates that the HTTP request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials usually username and password for the target resource If the request included authentication credentials the 401 response indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials Please check if your username and password are correct HTTP status 403 Forbidden This is a permissions issue You often encounter this error when no index file htm html or php is present and the directory listing is off for a folder in the Web space Line Options Indexes in a htaccess file Sometimes user authentication was provided but the authenticated user is not permitted to view the content of the folder or file Other times the operation is forbidden to all users Sometimes this error occurs if there are too many connections at the same time HTTP status 404 Not Found This error message is shown when a site or folder on a server are requested but cannot be found at the given URL Please check your inputted URL HTTP status 429 Too Many Requests The HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response status code indicates the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time A RetryAfter header might be included to this response indicating how long to wait before making a new request For example if more than 50 requests are received from the same IP address cumulative hits within the same second our server will block that IP for the next 10 minutes as a security measure HTTP status 500 Internal Server Error This is a catch all status for unexpected errors It is a server side error message common causes of this are eg misconfigured htaccess files or PHP errors which you can check in the File phperrorlog on your Web host You can find the phperrorlog file in the log directory this directory can be found on the same level as your html directory HTTP status 503 Service unavailable This means that the server is currently unavailable or the server is over allocated You can check the file phperrorlog as described for the status code 500 Should you not find helpful error messages in the log file please try changing the sessioncache to the option file system you can do this in the easy name control panel if you navigate to My HostingPHP settings and click the link Settings Please note that this change will take up to

bigger projects or complex apps as a result building reusable components and cleaner styles were hard to achieve CSS Preprocessorshttpsguidefreecodecamporgcsscsspreprocessors came to solve this problem and have been around for years now SASS LESS etc They extend CSS with key features like variables operators interpolations functions imports mixins etc However in Modern CSShttpsmediumcomactualizenetworkmoderncssexplainedfordinosaurs5226febe3525 we now have a new powerful feature called Custom properties otherwise known as CSS variables or cascading variables Now you can declare variables directly in your CSS without having to use CSS Preprocessors In this article Id show you how to start using CSS variables Lets roll If youre familiar with JavaScript or other programming languages you should understand how variables work already let name Bolaji Ayodeji A variable stores some sort of information or data that would be used later in your program consolelogname What are CSS variables Custom properties sometimes referred to as CSS variables or cascading variables are entities defined by CSS authors that contain specific values to be reused throughout a document They are set using custom property notation MDN DOCS CSS variables syntax A CSS Variable is defined with a special syntax with two dashes before the variable name variablename then a colon and the variable value container black 000 Accessing the variable You can access the already declared variable using var container black 000 color varblack Variables Scope CSS Variables can be defined inside any CSS element body color red h1 color red p color red span color red a color red However adding variables to a selector makes them available to ONLY their children If you add a variable inside a container selector its only going to be available to children of container Outside container the variable will not work pen idBbMGqr Though we set p to be red it works for only p tags within container any p outside container will not inherit this style root root is a CSS pseudoclass that identifies the document itself A better way to declare CSS variables is to add the variable to root this makes it available to all the elements in the page pen idgEqZOe Now all p tags are red irrespective of their position or parent CSS Variables are case sensitive This variable color red is not the same as Color red Setting a fallback value for var var accepts a second parameter which is the default fallback value when the variable value is not set p color varred f00 pen idxBMmrq Here we forgot to declare red but p still has the red color because we already have a fallback value Browser Support httpscdnimages1mediumcommax12001HHDutFGICwb84UsH91rsQpng Browser support for CSS Variables according to Can I Usehttpswwwcaniusecomfeatcssvariables CSS variables are supported in modern browsers I personally dont focus on IE and far older browsers because a large number of internet users are using modern browsers now just a few arent So If you dont need to support Internet Explorer and old versions of the other browsers CSS variables should be your best friend Conclusion CSS Variables follow the normal CSS cascading rules with precedence set according to the specificity We can also use the values of custom properties in JavaScript just like standard properties Complex websites have very large amounts of CSS often with a lot of repeated values For example the same color might be used in hundreds of different places requiring global search and replace if that color needs to change Custom properties allow a value to be stored in one place then referenced in multiple other places An additional benefit is semantic identifiers For example black is easier to understand than 00000 especially if this same color is also used in other contexts MDN CSS variables are cool and have come to stay if you want your CSS styles and development to become clean easier and more efficient you should stick to CSS variables For more knowledge read

languages that make up the repository With GitHub you can view a repositorys languages to get a quick overview of the repository But how does this happen What powers this repository language overview In this article I would Introduce you to GitHub Linguist How it works How to fix common Linguist issues How to use gitattributesto override Linguist How to use Emacs or Vim modelines to override Linguist How to contribute to GitHub Linguist Lets Roll You might have noticed this section at the top of your GitHub repositories that gives you an overview of languages contained in the repository httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001FWBD77YB6yedoMIc04BSOApng Well GitHub uses the open source Linguist libraryhttpsgithubcomgithublinguist to determine file languages for syntax highlighting and repository statistics Language statistics will update after you push changes to your default branch which is usually master What is GitHub Linguist GitHub Linguist is a library is used on GitHubcom to detect blob languages ignore binary or vendored files suppress generated files in diffs and generate language breakdown graphs Source GitHub Linguist Docs Basically Linguist is a library that runs on every GitHub repository It checks every file and directory and detects the programming language used in that file How does Linguist work Linguist takes the list of languages it knows from languagesyml and uses a number of methods to try and determine the language used by each file and the overall repository breakdown Linguist starts by going through all the files in a repository and excludes all files that it determines to be binary data vendored code generated code documentation or are defined as data eg SQL or prose eg Markdown languages whilst taking into account any overrides The result of this analysis is used to produce the language stats bar which displays the languages percentages for the files in the repository The percentages are calculated based on the bytes of code for each language as reported by the List Languageshttpsdevelopergithubcomv3reposlistlanguages API How to fix common Linguist issues Some files are hard to identify and sometimes projects contain more library and vendor files than their primary code If youre receiving incorrect language analysis then read below for common Linguist issues and how to fix them My repository isnt showing my language Linguist does not consider vendored codehttpsgithubcomgithublinguistvendoredcode generated codehttpsgithubcomgithublinguistgeneratedcode documentationhttpsgithubcomgithublinguistdocumentation or data eg SQL or prose eg Markdown languages as defined by the type attribute in languagesyml when calculating the repository language statistics If the language statistics bar is not showing your language at all it could be for a few reasons 1 Linguist doesnt know about your language 1 The extension you have chosen is not associated with your language in languagesyml eg saving a JavaScript file as appjss 1 All the files in your repository are either vendored codehttpsgithubcomgithublinguistvendoredcode generated codehttpsgithubcomgithublinguistgeneratedcode or documentationhttpsgithubcomgithublinguistdocumentation eg SQL prose Markdown Linguist excludes these files by default If Linguist doesnt know about the language or the extension youre using consider contributinghttpsgithubcomgithublinguistblobmasterCONTRIBUTINGmd to Linguist by opening a pull request to add support for your language or extension You can also to tell Linguist to include your files in the language statistics by overidding it Id explain how in a bit read along My repository is detected as a wrong language If the language stats bar is reporting a language that you dont expect 1 Click on the name of the language in the stats bar to see a list of the files that are identified as that language Keep in mind this performs a search so the code search restrictionshttpshelpgithubcomarticlessearchingcodeconsiderationsforcodesearch may result in files identified in the language statistics not appearing in the search results Installing Linguist locallyhttpsgithubcomgithublinguistusage and running it from the command linehttpsgithubcomgithublinguistcommandlineusage will give you accurate results 1 If the files are misclassified search for open issueshttpsgithubcomgithublinguistissues on the Linguist Library to see if anyone else has already reported the issue 1 If no issue solves your problem open an issuehttpsgithubcomgithublinguistissuesnew on Linguist and include a link to the repository or a sample of the code that is being misclassified Keep in mind that the repository language stats are only updated when you push changes and the results are cached for the lifetime of your repository If you have not made any changes to your repository in a while you may find pushing another change will correct the stats A great way to fix this is using the manual override feature to correctly classify languages in your repository How to use gitattributes to overriding Linguist Just as you can customize an override the default configurations of a gaming control pad you can also use custom override strategies for language definitions and file paths in Linguist Basically gitattributes is just a file used to command or tell Git to perform some specific tasks sort of a way to tweaking it Heres how to use the Linguist override feature Add a gitattributes file to the root of your project touch gitattributes Use the standard gitstyle path matchers for the files you want to override using the linguistdocumentation linguistlanguage linguistvendored linguistgenerated and linguistdetectable

linguistlanguage attribute to override language extensions gitattributes file which reclassifies js files as Java js linguistlanguageJava Using the linguistvendored attribute to vendor or unvendor

before but you probably didnt understand what it really meant Ive seen this word before also but didnt care to check it out until Egwuenu Gifthttpsmediumcomu46bccfc2f42c organized JAMstack Lagoshttpstwittercomjamstacklagos then I realised that Ive been building JAMstack applications already JAMstack is a Modern web development architecture it is not a programming language or any form of tool It is more of a web development practice aimed towards enforcing better performance higher security lower cost of scaling and better developer experience In this article Ill introduce you to what JAMstack means why you should care best practices and how to get started Introduction httpscdnimages1mediumcommax7200t3L6Et7RRLXjRcEpng According to the official JAMstack documentationhttpsjamstackorg JAMstack is a Modern web development architecture based on clientside JavaScript reusable APIs and prebuilt Markup When we talk about The Stack we no longer talk about operating systems specific web servers backend programming languages or databases The JAMstack is not about specific technologies Its a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance higher security lower cost of scaling and a better developer experience JAMstack is a major trend in web development coined by Mathias Biilmanhttpstwittercombiilmann the CEO and cofounder of Netlify Okay chill what is JAMstack You might have come across specific terms like MEAN stack and MERN stack These are just terms used to classify or group some certain technologies with the aim of achieving a particular goal JAMstack here stands for JavaScript API Markup stacks generally is just a combination of several technologies used to create a web or mobile application So JAMstack is the combination of JavaScript APIs and Markup Pretty interesting right JAMstack projects dont rely on serverside code they can be distributed instead of relying on a server Served directly from a CDN JAMstack apps unlock speed performance and better the user experience httpscdnimages1mediumcommax7201033Z3JaRzCm46ro7AbD3Apng Useful Terms Ill be using these terms in this article frequently and I thought you should know their meanings If you dont API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other CDN content delivery network is a system of distributed servers network that deliver pages and other Web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user the origin of the webpage and the content delivery server A Server is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to another computer over the internet or a local network A Database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed managed and updated Why JAMstack httpscdnimages1mediumcommax7200HbtT08v5SNGIFXopng Unlike traditional websites or CMS sites eg Wordpress Drupal etc that relies so much on servers plugins and databases JAMstack can load some JavaScript that receives data from an API serving files from a CDN and markup generated using a static site generator during deploy time Sounds cool right JAMstack is fast When it comes to minimizing the time of load nothing beats prebuilt files served over a CDN JAMstack sites are super fast because the HTML is already generated during deploy time and just served via CDNhttpsflaviocopescomcdn without any interference or backend delays JAMstack is highly secured Everything works via an API and hence no database or security breach With serverside processes abstracted into microservice APIs surface areas for attacks are reduced and hence your site becomes highly secured JAMstack is cheaper and easy to scale JAMstack sites only contain just a few files with minimal sizes that can be served anywhere scaling is a matter of serving those files somewhere else or via CDNs JAMstack Best Practices Use CDN to distribute your files rather than servers Installing and contributing to your project should be easy and less complex use tools like npm and Git to ensure standard and faster setup Use build tools and make your project compatible for all browsers eg Babel Browserify Webpack etc Ensure your project is up to web standards and highly accessible Ensure your build process is automated to reduce stress Make your deployment process automatic you can use platforms like Netlifyhttpsnetlifycom to do this How do I Get Started You can use some already built technologies to build JAMstack applications in a few minutes Here are a few

Babelhttpsbabeljsio is a free and opensource JavaScript compiler and configurable transpiler which is commonly used for transpiling ES6 Babel was created by Sebastian McKenzienhttpsgithubcomkittens JavaScript Developer facebook httpfacebookcomin September of 2014 It was originally called 6to5 but was later renamed to Babel With the release of Babel 6 the focus turned more towards making Babel pluggable The default action for Babel in version 6 is not to transform your ES6 to ES5 anymore but towards making Babel pluggable Allows you to create plugins to transform your code so you now have to include various presetshttpsbabeljsiodocsenpresets The latest release is Babel 7 Babel has support for the latest version of JavaScript through syntax transformers These plugins allow you to use new syntax right now without waiting for browser support httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8000DCOgES9vSiGtSUypjpg How Babel works Things you should know Transpilers or sourcetosource compilers are tools that read source code written in one programming language and produce the equivalent code in another language Wikipedia NPMhttpswwwnpmjscom is a package manager for JavaScript with a huge listing of reusable code modules and packages You can specify all of your projects dependencieshttpsdocsnpmjscomfilespackagejsondependencies inside your packagejson file then any time you or anyone else needs to get started with your project they can just run npm install and immediately have all of the dependencies installed local packages are installed in the directory where you run npm install and they are put in the nodemodules folder inside this directory You must install in the project directory global packages are all put in a single place in your system exactly where depends on your setup and OS regardless of where you run npm install g You can install anywhere In general all packages should be installed locally there are two primary reasons for this 1 Different projects on the same machine can depend on different versions of packages allowing you to update one at a time 1 It means you do not have an implicit dependency on the environment you are working in Making your project far more portable and easier to set up A package should be installed globally when it provides an executable command that you run from the shell CLI and its reused across projects eg createreactapp nodemon npm

files For testing purposes create these files in the right structure as shown below public indexhtml src appjs mathjs Tip you can create files in the command line by running touch followed by the file name extension ie touch appjs Installing Babel CLI Before we proceed you need to install Nodejshttpsnodejsorg Head herehttpsnodejsorgendownload download and install the latest version for your Operating system To confirm if nodejs is installed properly node v should return the version the installed v10130 Next you need to generate your packagejson file All npm packages contain a file usually in the project root called packagejson this file holds various metadata relevant to the project This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the projects dependencies Sourcehttpsdocsnodejitsucomarticlesgettingstartednpmwhatisthefilepackagejson npm init This will walk you through a few questions like what is the name of your project version description etc When it asks you about the entry point you can leave it as appjs for now Typically this is the primary entry point to your program Read npm

herehttpsbabeljsiosetupinstallation npm install savedev babelcore babelcli This might take a while pending on your network strength After running this three things should happen You should have a new subfolder in your project root nodemodules This is where all packages are installed Your packagejson should have some new entry devDependencies babelcli 723 babelcore 722 You should have a new file also packagelockjson This files basically stores all information about the newly installed packages so if someone else would want to work on that project they could npm insatll and get the same dependencies on their machine Setting up Babel Presets As mentioned earlier Babel does not transpile to ES6 by default We have to include some pluginshttpsbabeljsiodocsplugins To start you can use the env presethttpsbabeljsiodocspluginspresetenv which enables transforms for ES2015 npm install babelpresetenv savedev Now your packagelockjson should be updated with more dependencies babelrc Configurations babelrc is the configuration file used to manage your presets and plugins touch babelrc Inside the created file add this presets babelpresetenv Basically this tells babel to use the envpreset you installed earlier This configuration might change depending on your setup Some Online Editors automatically run Babel for you JSFiddlehttpsjsfiddlenetfh5whLfd JSBinhttpjsbincomrokimopuseedithtmljsconsoleoutput CodepenhttpcodepenioanonpendOGgeO Folder Structure At the end of all this your folder structure should look like this nodemodules public indexhtml src appjs mathjs babelrc packagejson packagelockjson NPM Scripts Configurations Now lets setup NPM to run babel on the CLI In your packagejson there is a section called scripts This holds various commands to be performed on your project Some common commands are start build test etc scripts some commands here A list of all commands can be found herehttpsdocsnpmjscommiscscripts Now add this to the script section scripts build babel src d public Adding the above to our packagejson in the scripts section will take our code from src run it through Babel and output the file in public NB Scripts are written as JSON objects if you have multiple commands seperate them with a comma A common practice is to set up watching Watching simply listens for file changes and automatically transpilesYou dont need to run the command everytime you make a change edit your build script and add w or watch scripts build babel src d public w Lets test Babel Lets use the files from my last tutorial In srcmathjs add this let sumAll a b return a b let subtractAll a b return a b let divideAll a b return a b let multiplyAll a b return a b export default sumAll subtractAll divideAll multiplyAll In srcappjs add this import math from mathjs consolelogmathsumAll50 10 consolelogmathsubtractAll50 10 consolelogmathmultiplyAll50 10 consolelogmathdivideAll50 10 To test this code add srcappjs to the indexhtml Open the HTML and view console you should get 60 40 500 5 Now lets reset out script path to the transpiled JavaScript To begin Babel transpiling run npm run build httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001LAgfdweuunW2Mn2XZyrMIApng Now Babel has done its magic publicappjs should look like this now It is now ES5 and crossbrowser compatible Also publicmathjs should look like this Now If you run your HTML youd get this error in the console Uncaught ReferenceError require is not defined This is because in appjs our import statement is transpiled into ES5 and it becomes require var math interopRequireWildcardrequiremathjs Browsers dont have the require method defined but Nodejs does If you run appjs in node you will get the right results Open your CLI and run node publicappjs httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001uZv33lB3pLT0csriGsMATgpng So basically using Babel for Vanilla JavaScript is an overkill you would run into errors Babel is mostly used with Node or frameworks like React and Angular A great way to work with Babel in the browser is to use code bundlers such as browserifyhttpbrowserifyorg webpackhttpswebpackjsorg parcel httpsparceljsorgetc Module bundlers are used to bundle several modules into one or more optimized bundles for the browser This lets you use requiremodules in the browser by bundling up all of your dependencies Working with Browserify npm install g browserify Install the uniq module with npmhttpsnpmjsorg Uniq removes all duplicates from an array in place More details herehttpswwwnpmjscompackageuniq npm install uniq Now recursively bundle up all the required modules starting at appjs into a single file called bundlejs with the browserify command browserify appjs o bundlejs Add to your HTML Working with Parcel Parcel is a web application bundler differentiated by its developer experience It offers blazing fast performance utilizing multicore processing and requires zero configuration sourcehttpsparceljsorggettingstartedhtml To install npm install parcelbundler savedev Parcel can take any type of file as an entry point but an HTML or JavaScript file is a good place to start Modify your scripts in packagejson scripts dev parcel srcindexhtml build parcel build srcindexhtml To run in development mode Now open httplocalhost1234httplocalhost1234 in your browser Everything should log correctly now To build for production npm run build Youd get a new subfolder dist which contains your bundled files here you wont need public subfolder anymore you can delete it Read Parcel docshttpsparceljsorggettingstartedhtml for a complete and deep guide to all the features of Parcel Conclusion Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015 code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments Here are the main things Babel can do for you Transform syntax Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment through babelpolyfillhttpsbabeljsiodocsenbabelpolyfill Source code transformations codemods And more check out these videoshttpsbabeljsiovideoshtml for inspiration Please read Babel

Lighthouse date 20190128T1512212400 draft false type post tags Chrome Lighthouse devtools Chrome Lighthouse has been around for a while now but what if I ask you to explain what it does can you explain vividly I discovered that a lot of web developers including beginners have not heard about this tool and those who have have not tried it yet thats not cool In this article I would introduce you Chrome Lighthouse what it does and how to start using it Lets get started According to Wikipedia A lighthouse is a tower building or other types of structure designed to emit light from a system of lamps and lenseshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiLensoptics and to serve as a navigational aidhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiNavigationalaid for maritime pilotshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiMaritimepilot at sea or on inland waterways Okay lets turn this into a tech term Lighthouse is a tower building or other types of structure designed to emit light from a system under the Audits panel in Chrome Developer Tools and to serve as a guide for developers Making any sense Well Lighthouse is a tool developed by Google that analyzes web apps and web pages collecting modern performance metrics and insights on developer best practices Think of Lighthouse as the speedometer in a car that checks and balances the cars speed limit Basically Lighthouse works with developer best practices and performance metrics It runs checks on a web app and gives you feedback on errors practices below standard tips for better performance and how to fix them According to Google Developers Docs Lighthouse is an opensourcehttpsgithubcomGoogleChromelighthouse automated tool for improving the quality of web pages You can run it against any web page public or requiring authentication It has audits for performance accessibility progressive web apps and more You can run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools from the command line or as a Node module You give Lighthouse a URL to audit it runs a series of audits against the page and then it generates a report on how well the page did From there use the failing audits as indicators on how to improve the page Each audit has a reference doc explaining why the audit is important as well as how to fix it Thats pretty much all about Lighthouse It audits the URL of a web app and generates a report telling you how bad and good your web app is according to web standards and developers best practices Also attached to each section of the report is documentation explaining why that part of your app was audited why you should improve that part of your app and how to fix it Here is a demo of Lighthouse audits report for this blog httpsbolajiayodejicomhttpsbolajiayodehicom httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8801UDPKsgsImqhawyBshQfHwpng L My blog R Lighthouse audits report Pretty cool right What you should note is that I didnt get great scores like this on my first audit I had to use my first report to fix and improve the performance and quality of my app This is the idea behind Lighthouse it is to dentify and fix common problems that affect your sites performance accessibility and user experience Now lets move to the interesting part HOW TO GET STARTED LightHouse is available in three workflows Chrome Developer Tools Command line Node A Chrome extension I personally prefer using LightHouse in Dev Tools Using the extension does not make sense as the Dev Tool and extension work in the same chrome browser well our preference varies use what works best for you Lighthouse was first available only with the Chrome extension before it was added to the Chrome DevTools Using lighthouse on the command line is really cool alsoFor geeks Lets Get Started 1 Run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools Download Google Chrome web browser herehttpswwwgooglecomchromebrowserdesktop Note that Lighthouse can only be run on a desktop and not mobile Go to the URL you want to audit in Google Chrome You can audit any URL on the web Open Chrome DevTools CommandOptionC Mac ControlShiftC Windows Linux Chrome OS Click on the Audits panel httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8801ACdyR8RoTjoPNE4mNDeEwpng To the left is the viewport of the page that will be audited here thats my blog To the right is the Audits panel of Chrome DevTools which is now powered by Lighthouse Click on Run audits DevTools shows you a list of audit categories Ensure that you leave them all checked If you want to personalise what part of your app to be audited you can set that by checking the categories you want to audit After 60 to 90 seconds depending on your internet strength Lighthouse gives you a report on the page Not that your internet speed and pre installed extensions can affect lighthouse audits For better experience run audits in Icognito modehttpssupportgooglecomchromeanswer95464coGENIEPlatform3DDesktophlen to avoid any interference 2 Run Lighthouse in Command line Download Google Chrome web browser herehttpswwwgooglecomchromebrowserdesktop Download node herehttpsnodejsorgen If you have it installed already skip this step Install Lighthouse npm install g lighthouse or use yarn yarn global add lighthouse The g flag installs it as a global module Run your audits lighthouse Sample lighthouse httpsbolajiayodejicom By default Lighthouse writes the report to an HTML file You can control the output format by passing flags The report can be displayed in HTML or JSON format Output samples lighthouse saves reporthtml lighthouse output json json output sent to stdout lighthouse output html outputpath reporthtml saves reporthtml NOTE specifying an output path with multiple formats ignores your specified extension for ALL formats lighthouse output json output html outputpath myfilejson saves myfilereportjson and myfilereporthtml lighthouse output json output html saves reportjson and reporthtml lighthouse outputpathmydirfooout saveassets saves mydirfooreporthtml saves mydirfoo0tracejson and mydirfoo0devtoolslogjson lighthouse outputpathreportjson output json saves reportjson Run lighthouse help for CLI options 3 Run Lighthouse with the Chrome extension As I earlier said The DevTools workflow is the best as it provides the same benefits as the Extension workflow with the added bonus of no installation needed To use this method you need to install the extension but If you have your reasons here is the guide Download Google Chrome web browser herehttpswwwgooglecomchromebrowserdesktop Install the Lighthouse Chrome Extensionhttpschromegooglecomwebstoredetaillighthouseblipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk from the Chrome Webstore Navigate to the page you want to audit Click Lighthouse Icon It should be next to the Chrome address bar If not open Chromes main menu the three dots on the upper right and access it at the top of the menu After clicking the Lighthouse menu expands Click Generate report Lighthouse runs its audits against the opened page then opens up a new tab with a report of the results Bingo You did it Thats pretty much it Lighthouse is a great tool especially for beginners It is a very useful tool when it comes to auditing Progressive web apps read my other article herehttpsbolajiayodejicomjshowtobuildasimpleprogressivewebappwithpwafireandeploytogithubagesandfirebase to learn more about PWA I actually learned so much about optimization and performance standards when I started using Lighthouse In no time you would become an expert in building full optimized web apps with great performance accessibility and user experience Lighthouse is not magic it was created by humans It is open source and contributions are welcomehttpsgithubcomGoogleChromelighthouseblobmasterCONTRIBUTINGmd Check out the repositorys issue trackerhttpsgithubcomGoogleChromelighthouseissues to find bugs that you can fix or audits that you can create or improve upon The issues tracker is also a good place to discuss audit metrics ideas for new audits or anything else related to Lighthouse Thank you for reading this after installing and using Lighthouse share your success stories You can tweet to me via

draft false type post tags javascript es6 modules httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001DDHE2Adf04v4EYcYbAUWSgpng An essential aspect of software engineering is efficiency Every successful app needs a solid architectural structure that allows it to scale at all levels without breaking In respect to this several techniques and patterns are engaged to ensure code efficiency In this article I would introduce you to ES6 modules what they are how to use them and why you should care 00 What exactly is a module In JavaScript the word modules refers to small units of independent reusable code They are the foundation of many JavaScript design patterns and are critically necessary when building any substantial JavaScriptbased application In simpler terms modules help you to write code in your module and expose only those parts of the code that should be accessed by other parts of your code JavaScript has had modules for a long time However they were implemented via libraries not built into the language ES6 is the first time that JavaScript has builtin modules Each module is a piece of code that is executed once a JavaScript file is loaded In that code there may be declarations variables functions classes etc By default every declaration in that file stay local to that module and cannot be accessed in other modules unless the module file exports them What are ES6 Modules Before now it was impossible to directly reference or include one JavaScript file in another as such developers therefore resorted to alternative options like multiple HTML script tags consoleloginline code This is a bad practice as each script initiates a new HTTP request which affects page performance and disrupts further processing while it runs Lets say we have a file appjs and included in this file is a function which checks every limit in a number and returns if its EVEN or ODD function showNumberslimit let i 0 i With ES6 modules you can concatenate all scripts in one main script by marking some of them as exports then other modules can import them httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001rJdvreyM4VKoMpMOjn4gLApng How ES6 modules work Before ES2015 release there were at least 3 major modules competing standards Asynchronous Module Definition AMD RequireJS Modules CommonJS Modules A single native module standard was therefore proposed in ES6 ES2015 ES6 modules is a very powerful concept although support is not available everywhere yet a common way of using it is to transpile into ES5 You can use Grunthttpsgruntjscom Gulphttpsgulpjscom Webpackhttpswebpackjsorg Babehttpsbabeljsiol or some other transpiler to compile the modules during a build process Transpilers or sourcetosource compilers are tools that read source code written in one programming language and produce the equivalent code in another language Wikipedia Browsers with ES6 modules support May 2017 SourcehttpscodepeniosamthorpenMmvdOM httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001XzKcB3WRsVg3K2TapBbghgpng What you should know Everything inside an ES6 module is private by default and runs in strict mode theres no need for use strict Public variables functions and classes are exposed using export Exposed modules are called into other modules using import Modules must be included in your HTML with typemodule which can be an inline or external script tag or an inline script Modules are deferredhttpsdevelopermozillaorgendocsWebHTMLElementscriptattrdefer and only run after a document is loaded For an indepth knowledge about ES6 modules read herehttpsponyfoocomarticleses6modulesindepth How to use ES6 modules For this article lets create three files appjs mathjs and maxjs In mathjs lets write a basic arithmetic algorithm let sumAll a b return a b let subtractAll a b return a b let divideAll a b return a b let multiplyAll a b return a b let findModulus a b return a b Now to make this module accessible to other parts of our code we need to export them There are several ways of doing this You can export each module individually export let sumAll a b return a b export let subtractAll a b return a b export let divideAll a b return a b export let multiplyAll a b return a b export let findModulus a b return a b A better way is to use a single export statement let sumAll a b return a b let subtractAll a b return a b let divideAll a b return a b let multiplyAll a b return a b let findModulus a b return a b export sumAll subtractAll divideAll multiplyAll findModulus You can also export default values export default sumAll subtractAll multiplyAll divideAll Note You only export modules you want to use in other parts of your code its not mandatory for you to export every module in this script Now to use our exported modules we need to import them in appjs There are several ways of doing this also You can import individually import sumAll from mathjs Lets test our import consolelogsumAll9 8 17 You can import multiple modules at once import sumAll subtractAll divideAll from mathjs You can import modules as aliases In some computer operating systems and programming languages an alias is an alternative and usually easiertounderstand or more significant name for a defined data object More details herehttpssearchmicroservicestechtargetcomdefinitionalias import as math from mathjs Here we have imported all the modules in mathjs and assigned them to the alias math To use this imported module we do this consolelogmathsumAll50 10 60 consolelogmathsubtractAll50 10 40 consolelogmathmultiplyAll50 10 500 consolelogmathdivideAll50 10 5 consolelogmathfindModulus50 15 5 You can also import default values import math from mathjs consolelogmathsumAll5 2 7 Here we have imported sumAll in mathjs and assigned it to the alias math There is no need to add as here If you dont export as default and you import using this method you will get this error Uncaught SyntaxError The requested module mathjs does not provide an export named default To use this method you must export sumAll as default export default sumAll You can also use an absolute path for the module import to reference modules defined on another domain import sumAll from httpsbolajimoduleglitchmesumAlljs consolelogsumAll50 10 60 Note Modules are fetched using CORShttpsdevelopermozillaorgenUSdocsWebHTTPCORS This means that if you reference scripts from other domains they must have a valid CORS header that allows crosssite loading Modules are imported with either absolute or Relative references and must start with either or import sumAll from mathjs import sumAll from libmaxjs import sumAll from mathjs import sumAll from maxjs import sumAll from httpsbolajimoduleglitchmesumAlljs You can import several modules from different files in our maxjs add this let max a b return a b a b export max Now you can import maxjs and mathjs together in appjs import as math from mathjs import max from maxjs consolelogmax50 10 50 consolelogmathsubtractAll50 10 40 consolelogmathmultiplyAll50 10 500 consolelogmathdivideAll50 10 5 You can import multiple files but we must also remember that having more than a few modules is going to reduce our apps performance only use modules when needed Some Advantages of using modules Code can be split into smaller files of selfcontained functionality Multiple scripts can be concatenated thereby increasing performance Debugging becomes easier Any code referencing a module understands it is a dependency If the module file is changed or moved the problem is immediately obvious Modules usually helps eradicate naming conflicts Function sumAll in module1 cannot clash with Function sumAll in module2 Aliases are very useful here it becomes module1sumAll and module2sumAll ES6 Modules are always executed in strict mode so there is no need for use strict ES6 modules help you to organize your code better CONCLUSION ES6 Modules are one of the biggest features introduced in modern browsers Modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue JS and React JS use this feature You should also know that ES6 modules are not supported in all browsers For production applications transpilers like Webpack and Babel are used to convert our code from ES6 to ES5 to ensure crossbrowser compatibility In respect to this article I would be writing two more articles tomorrow to show you how to use Babelhttpbabelio as your transpiler The article will cover an introduction guide to installing and setting up Babel and how to efficiently work with nodemodules in development and production Subscribe to my newsletter herehttpseepurlcomgeCCfL and get notified when it drops So this it while you await the Babel transpiler article practice all you learnt from this article use it in different projects and try all methods explained to get a better grasp of ES6 modules Two things you need to do Use a Live server to run your HTML files Download web server for chrome

VScodehttpsmarketplacevisualstudiocomitemsitemNameritwickdeyLiveServer AtomhttpsmarketplacevisualstudiocomitemsitemNameritwickdeyLiveServer Dont forget to add typemodule when adding your main script When you use transpilers you wont need all this Check out my last article I wrote on Manipulating JavaScript Arrayshttpsbolajiayodejicomjsmanipulatingarraysinjavascript Confused or got questions

Cases date 20190104T1322142400 draft false type post tags javascript es6 developers In this short article I will introduce you to JavaScript switch cases and how to use them with practical examples PS This article is not for those without any JavaScript knowledge it is expected that youre taking some tutorial or course and you just got to the switch cases section This article will explain better with more practical examples to help you understand switch cases in depth Prerequisites Basic JavaScript knowledge Code editor Web Browser Your brain A switch statement can basically replace multiple if checks in JavaScript It gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants The Switch Syntax The switch has one or more case blocks and an optional default case switchx case value1 if x value1 code here break case value2 if x value2 code here break default code here break The value of x is checked for strict equality to the value from the first case that is value1 then to the second value2 and so on If the equality is found switch starts to execute the code starting from the corresponding case until the nearest breakor until the end of switch If no case is matched then the default code is executed if it exists Some few real examples Simple Play Pause Switch The switch statement can be used for multiple branches based on a number or string switch movie case play playMovie break case pause pauseMovie break default doNothing If you dont add a break statement the execution will fall through to the next level Its essential that you deliberately label the fall through with a comment if you really meant it to aid debugging switch movie case play fallthrough case pause pauseMovie break default doNothing The default clause is optional You can have expressions in both the switch part and the cases if you like comparisons take place between the two using the operator switch 3 7 case 5 5 correct break default neverhappens Simple Maths Calc Switch let average 2 6 switch average case 4 alert Too small break case 8 alert Exactly break case 10 alert Too large break default alert Incorrect values Here the switch starts to compare average from the first case variant that is 4 The match fails Then 8 Thats a match so the execution starts from case 8until the nearest break If there is no break then the execution continues with the next case without any checks Here is an example without break let average 2 6 switch average case 4 alert Too small case 8 alert Exactly case 10 alert Too big default alert Incorrect values In the example above well see sequential execution of three alerts alert Exactly alert Too big alert Incorrect values getDay method switch case The getDay method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6 Sunday0 Monday1 Tuesday2 Wednesday3 Thursday4 Friday5 Saturday6 This example uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name switch new DategetDay case 0 day Sunday break case 1 day Monday break case 2 day Tuesday break case 3 day Wednesday break case 4 day Thursday break case 5 day Friday break case 6 day Saturday The result of day will be the current weekday in day format PS This would change according to when youre reading this article I wrote this artcle on 01042019 which is a Friday so the result would be Friday The default Keyword The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match more like an else statement switch new DategetDay case 6 text Today is Saturday break case 0 text Today is Sunday break default text Its not weekend yet The result of text will be Its not weekend yet The default case does not have to be the last case in a switch block switch new DategetDay default text Its not weekend yet break case 6 text Today is Saturday break case 0 text Today is Sunday If default is not the last case in the switch block remember to end the default case with a break Conclusion There are so many practical examples of switch cases you can head here

httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8000WXgUQC2V92dkcYgZ Gif by Jona Dingeshttpsdribbblecomjonadinges What is Accessibility Lets start by defining accessibility and inclusion According to thesaurus dictionaryhttpswwwdictionarycombrowseaccessibility accessibility simply means easy to approach reach enter speak with or use Inclusion is a societal ideology regarding individuals with disabilities and special education Inclusion describes a group thats particularly welcoming to all kinds of people irrespective of their differences In computerhuman interaction accessibility simply means making the web accessible and having functionalities that can be operated by literally everyone including those with all forms of disabilities limitations and conditions Those with Disabilities According to WHO there are about 285000000 people in the world today Blind and visually impaired make up of the 285000000 people according to the World Health Organizationhttpwwwwhointmediacentrefactsheetsfs282en June 2012 with 39000000 categorized as legally blind and the remaining 246000000 visually impaired The deaf and hearing impaired make up 275000000 2004 in the moderatetoprofound hearing impairment category Some forms of disabilities include Physical disabilities One that affects a persons mobility or dexterity Intellectual or Learning Disabilities People with an intellectual learning or cognitive disability have a reduced capacity to read learn tasks or process information Visual impairments People with sight challenges visually impaired individuals and blind people Hearing impairments Deafness and hearing loss Neurological disabilities Disabilities associated with damage to the nervous system that results in the loss of some physical or mental functions Those with limitations conditions Disabilities can also be conditional A broken arm A loud restaurant Not speaking the local language etc All these are examples where someone may benefit from accessible practices Everybody is a keyboard user when they are eating with their mouse hand Adrian Roselli How can we help these people Web Accessibility comes to the rescue It is a practice whereby web applications are designed and developed so that its functionality can be operated by people with disabilities Web Accessibility Guidelines Throughout this article Ill refer to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 20httpswwww3orgTRWCAG20 a set of guidelines and best practices put together by web accessibility experts to address what accessibility means in a methodical way WCAG is organized around four principles often called The POUR Principle Perceivable Can users perceive the content This ensures that our applications are perceivable with sight touch or hearing senses via the browser or assistive technologies eg Screen readers Operable Can users use UI components easily and navigate the content For example something that requires a hover interaction cannot be operated by someone who cant use a mouse or touch screen This means users should be able to control your web apps elements using either the mouse keyboard or an assistive device Understandable Can users understand the content Can users understand the interface and is it clear and concise This ensures an easy understanding and smooth user experience Robust Can the content be consumed by a wide variety of users on several browsers This ensures compatibility of your app across several devices browsers or operating systems Web accessibility tips Now that you understand what Web Accessibility means and why you should care let me walk you through a few tips that would help you to build accessible websites Always add alternative texts to images Now that you understand what Web Accessibility means and why you should care let me walk you through a few tips that would help you to build accessible websites Always add alternative texts to images This is one thing most developers miss I used to miss this too when I started out because I didnt really understand the essence of alternative texts Alternative texts also know as alt is a word that can be inserted as an attribute in an HTML document to tell your website users the contents of an image The alt text appears in a blank box that would normally contain the image Alt text is useful when an image is not available because of a broken link changed URL or something else Alternative texts as the name imply serve as an alternative for screen readers They are read aloud to blind users on a screen reader and other screen assistive technologies You add alternative texts to images with the alt attribute Another important aspect of the alt attribute is that you should be specific when adding these texts For example examine the images below httpscdnimages1mediumcommax6000l82N5g3MF01TecNjpg Beautiful Aniekan Inyanghttpsmediumcomu61b12cb51464 Which of the code above would support accessibility more 1 or 2 httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001VwaIywCKRAu6d8M74gkQVgjpeg Which of the code above would support accessibility more 1 or 2 Now you should understand the context of being specific when using alternative texts You might not see the need you probably would not need it but a whole lot of users with disabilities need it Design your forms for Accessibility Ensure you add to your form elements though they might not be visible You can add labels for screen readers and still hide them from displaying to other users Full name Email address Telephone Ensure that your for attribute matches the id Always specify your web app language American english British english French If your app supports multiple languages or translations ensure to specify that too Dont use tables for anything except tabular data Dont autoplay video music or other media files Please avoid this Ensure that links are recognizable Either underlined or with a different colour Always provide a skip to main content option Skipping to main content links are useful for users who use keyboard navigation only Get Started Our story is a story which explains another story Cut the crap this is too long and I dont want to read

javascript es6 objects httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001KWR1E4S6N5uZiWPd0x9KRgpng Developers tend to know how to iterate through JavaScript Arrays easily but most times they tend to get confused while working with JavaScript Objects especially beginners and intermediates In this article Id show you Five 5 different ways of iterating through JavaScript Objects and some performance comparison tests to show you which is faster and more efficient Useful tips Property flags Object properties besides a value have three special attributes also known as flags writable if true can be edited else its readonly enumerable if true then listed in loops configurable if true the property can be deleted and these attributes can be modified When we create a property the usual way all of them are true But we can change them anytime The method ObjectgetOwnPropertyDescriptorhttpsdevelopermozillaorgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptReferenceGlobalObjectsObjectgetOwnPropertyDescriptor allows us to query the full information about a property What does an enumerable property mean Enumerable properties are those properties whose internal enumerable flag is set to true which is the default for properties created via simple assignment Basically if you create an object via obj foo bar or something thereabouts all the properties are enumerable 1 forin loop The forin loop statement can be used to iterate over all nonSymbolhttpsdevelopermozillaorgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptReferenceGlobalObjectsSymbol enumerable propertieshttpsdevelopermozillaorgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptEnumerabilityandownershipofproperties of an object 2 Objectkeys The Objectkeys method returns an array of Object keys This creates an array that contains the properties of the object You can then loop through the array to get the keys and values you need 3 Objectvalues The Objectvalues method returns an array of Objects Values This creates an array that contains the properties of the object You can then loop through the array to get the keys and values you need 4 ObjectgetOwnPropertyNames The ObjectgetOwnPropertyNames method returns an array of all properties including nonenumerable properties except for those which use Symbol found directly in a given object This creates an array that contains the properties of the object You can then loop through the array to get the keys and values you need 5 Objectentries The Objectentries method returns an array of a given objects own enumerable property key value pairs Performance Comparison Now lets test all these techniques and compare each one based on their speed and performance to determine which is faster and much efficient Most browsers like Chrome and Firefox implement highresolution timing in performancenow The performancenow method returns a DOMHighResTimeStamp measured in milliseconds Usage let start performancenow code to be timed let duration performancenow start Lets begin testing Test Results According to our tests here are the results in ascending order httpsrescloudinarycomiambeejayayoimageuploadv1552257253looppng So according to these results the fastest way to iterate through JavaScript Objects is the forin loop Now this doesnt mean the other methods are void or useless it all depends on use cases The problem with a forin loop is that it iterates through properties in the Prototype chain It iterates over object properties Javascript arrays are just a specific kind of object with some handy properties that help you treat them as arrays but they still have internal object properties and you dont mean to iterate over these forinalso iterates over all enumerable properties and not just the arrays elements This can also lead to unexpected results When you loop through an object with the forin loop you need to check if the property belongs to the object You can do this with hasOwnProperty A better and more efficient way to loop through objects in ES6 is to first convert the object into an array using Objectkeys Objectvalues ObjectgetOwnPropertyNames or Objectentries Then you loop through the array to get the keys and values Reference httpjavascriptinfohttpjavascriptinfo

title Manipulating Arrays in JavaScript date 20190204T1322142400 draft false type post tags javascript es6 arrays Arrays have become an important part of any programming language Most times we need to do several operations on arrays hence this article In this article I would show you various methods of manipulating arrays in JavaScript httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8801EK3RyHqvMSZIy9UyNMxTApng What are Arrays in JavaScript Before we proceed you need to understand what arrays really mean In JavaScript an array is a variable that is used to store different data types It basically stores different elements in one box and can be later assesssed with the variable Declaring an array let myBox Initial Array declaration in JS Arrays can contain multiple data types let myBox hello 1 2 3 true hi Arrays can be manipulated by using several actions known as methods Some of these methods allow us to add remove modify and do lots more to arrays I would be showing you a few in this article lets roll NB I used Arrow functions in this post If you dont know what this means you should read herehttpsdevelopermozillaorgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptReferenceFunctionsArrowfunctions Arrow function is an ES6 feature toString The JavaScript method toString converts an array to a string separated by a comma let colors green yellow blue colorstoString consolelogcolors greenyellowblue join The JavaScript join method combines all array elements into a string It is similar to toString method but here you can specify the separator instead of the default comma let colors green yellow blue colorsjoin consolelogcolors greenyellowblue concat This method combines two arrays together or add more items to an array and then return a new array let firstNumbers 1 2 3 let secondNumbers 4 5 6 let merged firstNumbersconcatsecondNumbers consolelogmerged 1 2 3 4 5 6 push This method adds items to the end of an array and changes the original array let browsers chrome firefox edge browserspushsafari opera mini consolelogbrowsers chrome firefox edge safari opera mini pop This method removes the last item of an array and returns it let browsers chrome firefox edge browserspop edge consolelogbrowsers chrome firefox shift This method removes the first item of an array and returns it let browsers chrome firefox edge browsersshift chrome consolelogbrowsers firefox edge unshift This method adds an items to the beginning of an array and changes the original array let browsers chrome firefox edge browsersunshiftsafari consolelogbrowsers safari chrome firefox edge You can also add multiple items at once splice This method changes an array by adding removing and inserting elements The syntax is arrayspliceindex deleteCount element1 elementN Index here is the starting point for removing elements in the array deleteCount is the number of elements to be deleted from that index element1 elementN is the elements to be added Removing items after running splice it returns the array with the items removed and removes it from the original array let colors green yellow blue purple colorssplice0 3 consolelogcolors purple deletes green yellow blue NB The deleteCount does not include the last index in range If the second parameter is not declared every element starting from the given index will be removed from the array let colors green yellow blue purple colorssplice3 consolelogcolors green yellow blue deletes purple In the next example we will remove 3 elements from the array and replace them with more items let schedule I have a meeting tommorrow removes 4 first elements and replace them with another schedulesplice0 4 we are going to swim consolelogschedule we are going to swim tommorrow Adding items To add items we need to set the deleteCount to zero let schedule I have a meeting with adds 3 new elements to the array schedulesplice5 0 some clients tommorrow consolelogschedule I have a meeting with some clients tommorrow slice This method is similar to splice but very different It returns subarrays instead of substrings This method copies a given part of an array and returns that copied part as a new array It does not change the original array The syntax is arrayslicestart end Heres a basic example let numbers 1 2 3 4 numbersslice0 3 returns 1 2 3 consolelognumbers returns the original array The best way to use slice is to assign it to a new variable let message congratulations const abbrv messageslice0 7 s consolelogabbrv returns congrats split This method is used for strings It divides a string into substrings and returns them as an array Heres the syntax stringsplitseparator limit The separator here defines how to split a string either by a comma The limit determines the number of splits to be carried out let firstName Bolaji return the string as an array firstNamesplit Bolaji another example let firstName hello my name is bolaji I am a dev firstNamesplit 2 hello my name is bolaji NB If we declare an empty array like this firstNamesplit then each item in the string will be divided as substrings let firstName Bolaji firstNamesplit B o l a j i indexOf This method looks for an item in an array and returns the index where it was found else it returns 1 let fruits apple orange false 3 fruitsindexOforange returns 1 fruitsindexOf3 returns 3 friutsindexOfnull returns 1 not found lastIndexOf This method works the same way indexOf does except that it works from right to left It returns the last index where the item was found let fruits apple orange false 3 apple fruitslastIndexOfapple returns 4 filter This method creates a new array if the items of an array pass a certain condition The syntax is let results arrayfilterfunctionitem index array returns true if the item passes the filter Example Checks users from Nigeria const countryCode 234 144 233 234 const nigerian countryCodefilter code code 234 consolelognigerian 234 234 map This method creates a new array by manipulating the values in an array Example Displays usernames on a page Basic friend list display const userNames tina danny mark bolaji const display userNamesmapitem item const render displayjoin documentwriterender httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8801obuBZKFb5vKmUP7D4TX2XApng another example adds dollar sign to numbers const numbers 10 3 4 6 const dollars numbersmap number number consolelogdollars 10 3 4 6 reduce This method is good for calculating totals reduce is used to calculate a single value based on an array The syntax is let value arrayreducefunctionpreviousValue item index array initial example To loop through an array and sum all numbers in the array up we can use the for of loop const numbers 100 300 500 70 let sum 0 for let n of numbers sum n consolelogsum Heres how to do same with reduce const numbers 100 300 500 70 const sum numbersreduceaccummulator value accummulator value 0 consolelogsum 970 If you omit the initial value the total will by default start from the first item in the array const numbers 100 300 500 70 const sum numbersreduceaccummulator value accummulator value consolelogsum still returns 970 The snippet below shows how the reduce method works with all four arguments source MDN Docs httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8801Cbd9qRvy71qZjEQCFpCLQpng More insights into the reduce method and various ways of using it can be found herehttpsmediumfreecodecamporgreducef47a7da511a9 and herehttpsdevelopermozillaorgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptReferenceGlobalObjectsArrayReduce forEach This method is good for iterating through an array It applies a function on all items in an array const colors green yellow blue colorsforEachitem index consolelogindex item returns the index and the every item in the array 0 green 1 yellow 2 blue iteration can be done without passing the index argument const colors green yellow blue colorsforEachitem consolelogitem returns every item in the array green yellow blue every This method checks if all items in an array pass the specified condition and return true if passed else false check if all numbers are positive const numbers 1 1 2 3 let allPositive numberseveryvalue value 0 consolelogallPositive some This method checks if an item one or more in an array pass the specified condition and return true if passed else false checks if at least one number is positive const numbers 1 1 2 3 let atLeastOnePositive numberssomevalue value 0 consolelogatLeastOnePositive includes This method checks if an array contains a certain item It is similar to some but instead of looking for a specific condition to pass it checks if the array contains a specific item let users paddy zaddy faddy baddy usersincludesbaddy returns true If the item is not found it returns false There are more array methods this is just a few of them Also there are tons of other actions that can be performed on arrays try checking MDN docs herehttpsdevelopermozillaorgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptReferenceGlobalObjectsArray for deeper insights Summary toString converts an array to a string separated by a comma join combines all array elements into a string concat combines two arrays together or add more items to an array and then return a new array push adds items to the end of an array and changes the original array pop removes the last item of an array and returns it shift removes the first item of an array and returns it unshift adds an items to the beginning of an array and changes the original array splice changes an array by adding removing and inserting elements slice copies a given part of an array and returns that copied part as a new array It does not change the original array split divides a string into substrings

index where the item was found filter creates a new array if the items of an array pass a certain condition map creates a new array by manipulating the values in an array reduce calculates a single value based on an array forEach iterates through an array it applies a function on all items in an array every checks if all items in an array pass the specified condition and return true if passed else false some checks if an item one or more in an array pass the specified condition and return true if passed else false includes checks if an array contains a certain item Lets wrap it here Arrays are powerful and using methods to manipulate them creates the Algorithms realworld applications use Lets do a create a small function one that converts a post title into a urlSlug URL slug is the exact address of a specific page or post on your site When you write an article on Mediumhttpsmediumcom or any other writing platform your post title is automatically converted to a slug with white spaces removed characters turned to lowercase and each word in the title separated by a hyphen Heres a basic function that does that using some of the methods we learnt just now const url httpsbolajiayodejicom const urlSlug postTitle category let postUrl postTitletoLowerCasesplit let postSlug url category postUrljoin return postSlug let postTitle Introduction to Chrome Lighthouse let category dt consolelogurlSlugpostTitle category httpsbolajiayodejicomdtintroductiontochromelighthouse in postUrl we convert the string to lowercase then we use the split method to convert the string into substrings and returns it in an array introduction to chrome lighthouse in post slug we join the returned array with a hyphen and then concatenate it to the category string and main url let postSlug url category postUrljoin postUrljoin introductiontochromelighthouse Thats it pretty simple right If youre just getting started with JavaScript you should check this repository

"},{"title":"object.freeze-vs-const","href":"content/object.freeze-vs-const.md","content":" title Objectfreeze vs Const date 20190427T1322142400 draft false type post tags javascript es6 objects httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001JaXLkOnChRrhugh6jlQS7Apng ES6 has brought several new features and methods into JavaScript since its release These features have better improved our workflow and productivity as JavaScript developers Amongst these new features are Objectfreeze method and const It is argued among a few developers especially newbies that these two feature works the same way but NO it doesnt Objectfreeze and const work differently Let me show you how const and Objectfreeze are totally different const behaves like let the only difference is it defines a variable that cannot be reassigned Variables declared by const are block scoped and not function scoped like variables declared with var Objectfreeze takes an object as an argument and returns the same object as an immutable object This implies that no properties of the object can be added removed or changed Mutable objects have properties that can be changed immutable objects have no properties that can be changed after the object is created Examples Const const user Bolaji Ayodeji user Joe Nash This would throw an Uncaught TypeError because we are trying to reassign the variable user which was declared with the const keyword THIS IS NOT VALID httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001fkm8tv7a1jdhQSWa1Hl5tgpng Originally this would work with var or let but will not with const The problem with const When working with Objects using const only prevents reassignment and not immutability Ability to prevent changes to its properties Consider the code below We have declared a variable using the const keyword and assigned an object named user to it const user firstname bolaji lastname ayodeji email hibolajiayodejicom networth 2000 userlastname Samson this would work user is still mutable usernetworth 983265975975950 this would work too user is still mutable and getting rich consoleloguser user is mutated httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001fXjTs7lGxDXd3bFv2rF1Vgpng Although we cant reassign to this variable called object we can still mutate the object itself const user username bolajiayodeji wont work httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001hxSHWKuB8nopFHifETW9gpng We definitely would want to have Objects with properties that cannot be modified or deleted const cannot do this and this is where Objectfreeze saves the day Behold Objectfreeze To disable any changes to the object we need Objectfreeze const user firstname bolaji lastname ayodeji email hibolajiayodejicom networth 2000 Objectfreezeuser userlastname Samson this wont work user is still immutable usernetworth 983265975975950 this wont work too user is still immutable and still broke consoleloguser user is immutated httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001uiv64RdHsencUe9ZKptrbwpng Objects with nested properties are not actually frozen Well Objectfreeze is a bit shallow you will need to recursively apply it on nested objects to protect them const user firstname bolaji lastname ayodeji contact email hibolajiayodejicom telephone 08109445504 Objectfreezeuser userlastname Samson this wont work user is still immutable usercontacttelephone 07054394926 this will work because the nested object is not frozen consoleloguser httpscdnimages1mediumcommax8001xL0vmY5YC7n3hq5SfITVgpng So Objectfreeze doesnt fully freeze an object when it has properties which are nested To completely freeze objects and its nested properties you can write your own library or use already created libraries like Deepfreezehttpsgithubcomsubstackdeepfreeze or immutablejshttpsgithubcomimmutablejsimmutablejs Conclusion const and Objectfreeze are not the same const prevents reassignment and Objectfreeze prevents immutability Bonus Tip Want to learn modern JavaScript Ive got great news for you

tags education growth mindset developers I cant do it I cant learn this its too hard Come on Im just a Junior Developer WebPack is not my thing I tried it and failed Those are the words of a developer drenched and soaked with imposter syndrome Over time we keep fighting ourselves trying to run away from our shadows trying to find shortcuts yes I did also I really did At a point in my life I just felt some things were not meant for me I felt maths was too complex for me JavaScript was not my thing But come what if I was wrong what if maths is not complex what if JavaScript is not hard what if I just had a FIXED MINDSET In this article I would introduce you to the GROWTH MINDSET what it means and why you should care Lets get started WHAT DOES THE GROWTH MINDSET MEAN Carol Dweck is the Lewis Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology at Stanford University and the author of Mindset The New Psychology of SuccesshttpwwwamazoncomMindsetTheNewPsychologySuccessdp1400062756 Over 30 years ago Dr Carol DweckhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiCarolDweck and her colleagues became interested in students attitudes about failure They noticed that some students rebounded while other students seemed really devastated by even the smallest setbacks After studying this behaviour in a lot of children Dr Dweck coined the terms FIXED MINDSET and GROWTH MINDSET to describe the underlying beliefs people have about learning and intelligence According to the Harvard Business Review To briefly sum up the findings Individuals who believe their talents can be developed through hard work good strategies and input from others have a growth mindset They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset those who believe their talents are innate gifts This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning Now The Growth Mindset simply means having the mindset that your talents skills or strength can be developed over time It revolves around the belief that you can improve intelligence talents ability and performance The Fixed Mindset on the other end is the opposite it refers to the belief that a persons talents are fixed and generated from birth This revolves around the idea that once you cant do something from the onset it isnt meant for you Once you cant solve that arithmetic you conclude that maths is not your thing once you cant figure out that algorithm you conclude that programming is hard Recent advances in neuroscience have shown us that the brain is far more malleable than we ever knew Research on brain plasticity has shown how connectivity between neurons can change with experience With practice neural networks grow new connections strengthen existing ones and builds insulation that speeds transmission of impulses These neuroscientific discoveries have shown us that we can increase our neural growth by the actions we take such as using good strategies consistency asking questions practising and following good nutrition and sleep habits Mark Zuckerberg was not born a geek Sarah Drasnerhttpsmediumcomsarahedo was not born a Developer Avocado Ire Aderinokunhttpsmediumcomireade was not born a frontend developer Prosper Otemuyiwahttpsmediumcomunicodeveloper was not born on a Senior Level they all started from somewhere learning and Improving daily This is the Idea we should embrace as developersdesigners It is never easy and accepting this fact is the beginning of you moving forward but saying NO I CANT kills it all DO NOT ENTERTAIN THE IDEA OF HAVING FIXED TALENTS IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY SKILLS ARE IMPROVED TALENTS ARE SHARPENED The fact that you are not getting it perfectly now does not mean you should quit it only means you should be consistent and improve with practice and good strategies The Growth Mindset is not focused on caring about success or achievements but rather learning Learning is a process you just need to keep moving When learning especially something new the main goal should not be finishing but rather learning Advantages of The Growth Mindset The Growth Mindset is a very buzzing topic and research has shown how much increase in success it has birthed after its evolution Here are some of the merits It Improves and builds selfesteem learning orientation and reduces helplessness It reduces stress and aggression as well as increasing wellbeing and emotional stability It promotes adaptability and coping skills and develops better selfregulation It Strengthens your Confidence and never makes you feel stupid while learning It lowers your risk of Depression The list continues The growth mindset does allow people to love what theyre doing and continue to love it in the face of difficulties the growth mindset allows people to value what theyre doing regardless of the outcome Dr Dweck Now this is pretty much it Plants dont grow and become fruitful once its seed hit the ground it takes a lot of weeding watering manuring and strategies to make it grow This is how we operate as humans too you need to undergo a lot of good strategies and consistency to grow How do you build a Growth Mindset Truth be told we all had fixed mindsets at some point in our lives we probably did not know it was called that but we can build The GROWTH MINDSET Whats the best way to get started with your growth mindset revolution One way is to identify where you may have a fixed mindset tendency in your life or career so that you can work to become more growth minded We all live upon a continuum something that keeps on going changing slowly over time and consistent selfassessment helps us become the person we want to be Source Mindsetworks Here are just a few ways to get over the Fixed Mindset and become Growth Minded See Setbacks As Feedbacks Its easy to be frustrated by setbacks Yet they are useful because they provide information in the form of feedback A setback indicates that something went wrong or rather something is missing and you now have the opportunity to figure out what went wrong and why learn from it and prevent it from happening again The growth mindset sees setbacks as useful whereas a fixed mindset sees them as annoying hurdles and cause motivation or effort to drop Stop trying to prove yourself always In a fixed mindset success and achievements is a top priority You always want to be measured by others and you always want to be perfect The very act of succeeding requires that you show yourself to be better than others So if you focus on succeeding and achieving things youre always in a rush and your focus would be diverted In a growth mindset you dont care about proving yourself to others you only care about improving learning and growing Put more effort rather than running away If youre constantly interested in learning more and improving then you should put in more time and effort to do so Your company matters You should not hang out with folks with Fixed mindsets In fact hang out with those who are more Growth minded than you this way the check and balance you when you feel lazy I dont move with lazy folks Leksyhttpsmediumcomibolamilekan is my friend and each time I feel reluctant to learn something or want to quit because Im not getting it he tells me See I can learn any new language today If my next Job requires it all you need is The Growth Mindset Challenge yourself Learning is not an easy trade you need to challenge yourself pick up tasks you dont know and work on getting them done Spend more time doing stuff you dont know and get better doing them repeatedly Your mindset is the view you adopt of yourself whether your abilities and characteristics can change or whether they are set in stone the decision is all yours As developers designers or whatever tech field you belong too Learning is something that never ends in your career whatever youre running from whatever you want to learn brace up take your stance and decide to be Growth minded only you can make this decision
