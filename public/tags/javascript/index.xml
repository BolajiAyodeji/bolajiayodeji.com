      <description>Developers tend to know how to iterate through JavaScript Arrays easily but most times they tend to get confused while working with JavaScript Objects especially beginners and intermediates. In this article, I’d show you Five (5) different ways of iterating through JavaScript Objects and some performance comparison tests to show you which is faster and more efficient.
* Useful tips :) Property flags Object properties, besides a value, have three special attributes (also known as “flags”):</description>

      <description>As earlier stated in my previous article ES6 modules is a very powerful concept. Although support is not available everywhere yet, a common way of using it is to transpile into ES5. You can use Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, Babel or some other transpiler to compile the modules during a build process.
In this article, I’d guide through an introduction to transpiling ES6 with babel and bundling your modules with Browserify.</description>

      <description>Recently I discovered a new trend, a powerful web technology, one that every Web Developer should know, yeah I said every!
I first heard about PWA’s few months back, and at first it was weird trying to understand the concept and then trying to learn it. I stumbled on a link that led me to PWAFire an Open Sourced framework that helps you to Build Scalable Progressive Web Apps/First Experiences.</description>
