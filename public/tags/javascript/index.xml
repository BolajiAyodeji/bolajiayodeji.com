      <description>As earlier stated in my previous article ES6 modules is a very powerful concept. Although support is not available everywhere yet, a common way of using it is to transpile into ES5. You can use Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, Babel or some other transpiler to compile the modules during a build process.
In this article, I’d guide through an introduction to transpiling ES6 with babel and bundling your modules with Browserify.</description>

      <description>Recently I discovered a new trend, a powerful web technology, one that every Web Developer should know, yeah I said every!
I first heard about PWA’s few months back, and at first it was weird trying to understand the concept and then trying to learn it. I stumbled on a link that led me to PWAFire an Open Sourced framework that helps you to Build Scalable Progressive Web Apps/First Experiences.</description>
