      <description>As developers, it’s easy to assume that all users can see and use a keyboard, mouse or screen, you feel everyone can interact with your web page the same way you do. This can lead to a user experience that works well for some people but creates issues for others :(
Many developers have only a little or blurred understanding of what accessibility means, of course, accessibility can be a complex and difficult topic but understanding it, its scope and its impact can make you a better and inclusive web developer.</description>
