      <description>I’m sure you’ve come across the word JAMstack before but you probably didn’t understand what it really meant. I’ve seen this word before also but didn’t care to check it out until Egwuenu Gift organized JAMstack Lagos, then I realised that I’ve been building JAMstack applications already.
JAMstack is a Modern web development architecture, it is not a programming language or any form of tool. It is more of a web development practice aimed towards enforcing better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and better developer experience.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again. It builds pages when you create or update your content. Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast and secure like https://bolajiayodeji.com. In technical terms, Hugo takes a source directory of files and templates and uses these as input to create a complete website.
Hugo sites can be hosted anywhere, including Netlify, Heroku, GoDaddy, DreamHost, GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, Surge, Aerobatic, Firebase, Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Rackspace, Azure, and CloudFront and work well with CDNs.</description>
