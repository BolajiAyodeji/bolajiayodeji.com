      <description>In this tutorial, I would show you how to check, test and make changes to a pull request before merging.
Recently I dived into OpenSource development which i&amp;rsquo;m super psyched about now. I had some projects I made public and OpenSource on GitHub
Recently i started receiving pull requests and this was pretty awesome and encouraging. A great way to start the party
One major problem I had was how to test this pull requests, I had to use the local &amp;ldquo;copy and paste&amp;rdquo; method to test and run this pull requests before I merged them, this was really stressful.</description>

      <description>Easy Markdown to GitHub Pages Introduction This little guide demonstrates how to turn any Github repository with a bunch of Markdown files into a simple website using Github Pages and Jekyll.
 You don&amp;rsquo;t need to use the command line or anything other than your browser. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any knowledge in Jekyll. It&amp;rsquo;s completely compatible with any bunch of markdown files you already have in any existing repository without any modification to those files.</description>
