      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t do it, I can&amp;rsquo;t learn this, it&amp;rsquo;s too hard, Come on, I&amp;rsquo;m just a Junior Developer, WebPack is not my thing, I tried it and failed.
Those are the words of a developer drenched and soaked with imposter syndrome.
Over time we keep fighting ourselves, trying to run away from our shadows, trying to find shortcuts, yes I did also, I really did :(
At a point in my life, I just felt some things were not meant for me, I felt maths was too complex for me, JavaScript was not my thing!</description>

      <description>In this short article, I will introduce you to JavaScript switch cases and how to use them with practical examples.
PS: This article is not for those without any JavaScript knowledge, it is expected that you&amp;rsquo;re taking some tutorial or course and you just got to the switch cases section.
This article will explain better with more practical examples to help you understand switch cases in depth.
Prerequisites.  Basic JavaScript knowledge Code editor Web Browser Your brain :)  A switch statement can basically replace multiple if checks in JavaScript.</description>
