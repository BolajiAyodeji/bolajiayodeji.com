      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t do it, I can&amp;rsquo;t learn this, it&amp;rsquo;s too hard, Come on, I&amp;rsquo;m just a Junior Developer, WebPack is not my thing, I tried it and failed.
Those are the words of a developer drenched and soaked with imposter syndrome.
Over time we keep fighting ourselves, trying to run away from our shadows, trying to find shortcuts, yes I did also, I really did :(
At a point in my life, I just felt some things were not meant for me, I felt maths was too complex for me, JavaScript was not my thing!</description>
