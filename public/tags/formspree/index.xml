      <description>Forms are interactive elements used to get input from the user for further processing.

Most times, forms are just used to receive input that requires no processing but rather just receiving data, this might be a contact form, RSVP, get a quote e.t.c
Traditionally, forms are managed with the help of a server (also known as server side), but this is more efficient when you’re processing the data from the form, maybe a user registration form where the form data is validated, authenticated and saved in a database.</description>
