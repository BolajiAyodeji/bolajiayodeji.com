      <description>Less than a month ago, HTML 5.2 became an official W3C Recommendation (REC). When a specification reaches the REC stage, this means that it has received the official endorsement of W3C Members and the Director, and that the W3C officially recommends it�s deployment by user agents, and it�s implementation by web page authors.
By the REC stage, anything new should have had at least 2 independent implementations. This makes it a great time for us, as web page developers, to begin implementation of any new feature.</description>
