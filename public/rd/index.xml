      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t do it, I can&amp;rsquo;t learn this, it&amp;rsquo;s too hard, Come on, I&amp;rsquo;m just a Junior Developer, WebPack is not my thing, I tried it and failed.
Those are the words of a developer drenched and soaked with imposter syndrome.
Over time we keep fighting ourselves, trying to run away from our shadows, trying to find shortcuts, yes I did also, I really did :(
At a point in my life, I just felt some things were not meant for me, I felt maths was too complex for me, JavaScript was not my thing!</description>

      <description>Often time, we come across several errors while surfing through some websites which displays with a status code, as developers we need to be familiar with this status codes.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;d be explaining what each HTTP status code stand for.
What is an HTTP status code?
For every request from a web browser the server responds with a status code. If there was a error, you can get additional information about the error.</description>

      <title>The new features of HTML 5.2</title>

      <description>Less than a month ago, HTML 5.2 became an official W3C Recommendation (REC). When a specification reaches the REC stage, this means that it has received the official endorsement of W3C Members and the Director, and that the W3C officially recommends it�s deployment by user agents, and it�s implementation by web page authors.
By the REC stage, anything new should have had at least 2 independent implementations. This makes it a great time for us, as web page developers, to begin implementation of any new feature.</description>
