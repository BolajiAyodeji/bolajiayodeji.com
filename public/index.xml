      <description>Have you ever encountered Git asking you for your username and password every time you try to interact with GitHub even after configuring it? Well, this is a very common problem among users who use the HTTPS clone URL for their repository. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to fix this.
The https:// clone URLs are available on all public and private repositories. These URLs work everywhere, even if you are behind a firewall or proxy.</description>

      <description>Git is a Free and Open Source Distributed Version Control System.
By far, Git is the most widely used modern version control system in the world today. Git is a distributed and actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.
Unlike older centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of their code repository locally.</description>

      <description>C++ is a statically-typed, free-form, (usually) compiled, multi-paradigm, intermediate-level general-purpose middle-level programming language.‚Äù
In simple terms, C++ is a sophisticated, efficient and general-purpose programming language based on C.
It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979.
One of C++&amp;rsquo;s main feature is the compiler. This is used to compile and run C++ code.
  A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language like C++ and turns them into machine language or &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; that a computer&amp;rsquo;s processor uses.</description>

      <title>Handling Static Forms - The Client-side Way</title>

      <description>Forms are interactive elements used to get input from the user for further processing.

Most times, forms are just used to receive input that requires no processing but rather just receiving data, this might be a contact form, RSVP, get a quote e.t.c
Traditionally, forms are managed with the help of a server (also known as server side), but this is more efficient when you‚Äôre processing the data from the form, maybe a user registration form where the form data is validated, authenticated and saved in a database.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve come across the word JAMstack before but you probably didn‚Äôt understand what it really meant. I‚Äôve seen this word before also but didn‚Äôt care to check it out until Egwuenu Gift organized JAMstack Lagos, then I realised that I‚Äôve been building JAMstack applications already.
JAMstack is a Modern web development architecture, it is not a programming language or any form of tool. It is more of a web development practice aimed towards enforcing better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and better developer experience.</description>

      <description>ES6 has brought several new features and methods into JavaScript since its release. These features have better improved our workflow and productivity as JavaScript developers. Amongst these new features are Object.freeze() method and const .
It is argued among a few developers especially newbies that these two feature works the same way, but NO it doesn‚Äôt. Object.freeze() and const work differently. Let me show you how!
const and Object.freeze() are totally different.</description>

      <description>As developers, it‚Äôs easy to assume that all users can see and use a keyboard, mouse or screen, you feel everyone can interact with your web page the same way you do. This can lead to a user experience that works well for some people but creates issues for others :(
Many developers have only a little or blurred understanding of what accessibility means, of course, accessibility can be a complex and difficult topic but understanding it, its scope and its impact can make you a better and inclusive web developer.</description>

      <description>In the past years, maintaining CSS was a very big problem for bigger projects or complex apps as a result, building reusable components and cleaner styles were hard to achieve.
CSS Preprocessors came to solve this problem and have been around for years now (SASS, LESS, e.t.c). They extend CSS with key features like variables, operators, interpolations, functions, imports, mixins e.t.c.
However, in Modern CSS, we now have a new powerful feature called Custom properties, otherwise known as CSS variables or cascading variables.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again. It builds pages when you create or update your content. Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast and secure like https://bolajiayodeji.com. In technical terms, Hugo takes a source directory of files and templates and uses these as input to create a complete website.
Hugo sites can be hosted anywhere, including Netlify, Heroku, GoDaddy, DreamHost, GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, Surge, Aerobatic, Firebase, Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Rackspace, Azure, and CloudFront and work well with CDNs.</description>

      <description>As earlier stated in my previous article ES6 modules is a very powerful concept. Although support is not available everywhere yet, a common way of using it is to transpile into ES5. You can use Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, Babel or some other transpiler to compile the modules during a build process.
In this article, I‚Äôd guide through an introduction to transpiling ES6 with babel and bundling your modules with Browserify.</description>

Therefore, using an SSL-encrypted connection for safety, accessibility or PCI compliance reasons is necessary. It becomes very important to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.
