      <description>As developers, it’s easy to assume that all users can see and use a keyboard, mouse, or screen, you feel everyone can interact with your web page the same way you do. This can lead to a user experience that works well for some people but creates issues for others :(
Many developers have only a little or blurred understanding of what accessibility means, of course, accessibility can be a complex and difficult topic but understanding it, its scope and its impact can make you a better and inclusive web developer.</description>

      <description>In the past years, maintaining CSS was a very big problem for bigger projects or complex apps as a result, building reusable components and cleaner styles were hard to achieve.
CSS Preprocessors came to solve this problem and have been around for years now (SASS, LESS, e.t.c). They extend CSS with key features like variables, operators, interpolations, functions, imports, mixins e.t.c.
However, in Modern CSS, we now have a new powerful feature called Custom properties, otherwise known as CSS variables or cascading variables.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again. It builds pages when you create or update your content. Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast and secure like https://bolajiayodeji.com. In technical terms, Hugo takes a source directory of files and templates and uses these as input to create a complete website.
Hugo sites can be hosted anywhere, including Netlify, Heroku, GoDaddy, DreamHost, GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, Surge, Aerobatic, Firebase, Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Rackspace, Azure, and CloudFront and work well with CDNs.</description>

      <description>As earlier stated in my previous article ES6 modules is a very powerful concept. Although support is not available everywhere yet, a common way of using it is to transpile into ES5. You can use Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, Babel or some other transpiler to compile the modules during a build process.
In this article, I’d guide through an introduction to transpiling ES6 with babel and bundling your modules with Browserify.</description>

Those are the words of a developer drenched and soaked with imposter syndrome.
Over time we keep fighting ourselves, trying to run away from our shadows, trying to find shortcuts, yes I did also, I really did :(
At a point in my life, I just felt some things were not meant for me, I felt maths was too complex for me, JavaScript was not my thing!</description>
