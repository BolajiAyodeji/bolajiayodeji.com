      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t do it, I can&amp;rsquo;t learn this, it&amp;rsquo;s too hard, Come on, I&amp;rsquo;m just a Junior Developer, WebPack is not my thing, I tried it and failed.

Over time we keep fighting ourselves, trying to run away from our shadows, trying to find shortcuts, yes I did also, I really did :(

By the REC stage, anything new should have had at least 2 independent implementations. This makes it a great time for us, as web page developers, to begin implementation of any new feature.</description>
