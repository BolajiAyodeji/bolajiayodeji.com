Git cheat sheet saves you time when you just can’t remember a specific command.
It is hard to memorize all the important Git commands as a newbie, most times
Senior Developers forget too. This is why you need a reference you can come back
to when you get stuck.

In this article, I’d show you the basic Git commands to help you learn Git, and
more advanced concepts around Git branches, remote repositories, reverting
changes, and more. At the end of this article, I’d also show you some **Version
Control Best Practice**s.

Let’s get started :)

### Cheat Sheet Contents

* Git Basics

I believe you already know git and you probably should be using it, but in case
you don’t know:

> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to
> handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
Git manages your source code history and versions. More details

### Version Control Best Practises

* Commit Related Changes
* Don’t commit an unfinished work
* Your commit message should be clear enough and describes changes you made
* Add screenshots where possible to describe your changes better
* Ensure you open an issue first before you work on a new feature
* When pushing a new feature that was not discussed before, add a reason why you
made that commit
* Test your commits before you push
* Use branches to work on new features
* Always pull before you push
* Fix merge conflicts as soon as possible

### Conclusion

Git is a tricky tool to get your head around. Knowing the commands is one thing,
but knowing how and when to use them is another. This cheat-sheet would come in
handy whenever you forget any command.

Do share with your friends also, :)
