[Google](http://google.com) believes that open source is good for everyone. By
being open and freely available, it enables and encourages collaboration,
development of technology and solving real-world problems.

Over the years, Google has created a healthy ecosystem for the sustainability of
open source for all via its several communities 

> Beyond the open source software we directly use and release at Google, we also
> work to support the sustainability of open source organizations and communities.
Many of these efforts are focused on introducing new people to open source. —
Google

Some of these communities include:

* [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)

Google Summer of Code aims to bring new contributors into the open source
community by providing an opportunity for university students to spend their
summer working on open source. Students are paired with a mentor from a
participating organization to help them along the way. Many become lifetime
contributors! [Read more](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)

* [Google Code-In](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/)

Google Code-in is a global online contest introducing teenagers to the world of
open source. By completing bite-sized tasks, students earn prizes including a
grand prize trip to Google headquarters in California. Experienced open source
contributors provide mentorship and guidance making it easy for beginners to
jump in and get acquainted with open source. [Read

Google also participates in and support numerous open source organizations and
events throughout the community. Ranging from small grassroots efforts to
established foundations, these organizations play a critical role in the world
of open source. [View all

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*nLtsmQtPBXiI8p69.png)

March 11, 2019, Google announced the birth of a new community in a [blog
post](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/03/introducing-season-of-docs.html)
towards sustaining and supporting Open Source across the globe.

This new program is called [Google Season of
Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/)

Google Season of Docs is a program aimed at fostering the open source
contributions of technical writers. 

Just like [Google Summer of
Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) and [Google
Code-In](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/)*,* Season of Docs
brings technical writers and open source projects across the globe together to
work on open source documentation. The most exciting part is, this is the first
time GSoD is happening.

*****

Documentation is very important in Open Source, there is no Open Source Software
without documentation and this is why Google is launching this program to raise
awareness of open source, of docs, and of technical writing.

<br> 

#### How does it work?

The program includes three entities:

* Technical Writers
* Open Source Organizations
* Mentors

**Technical Writers**

During Season of Docs, technical writers will spend a few months working closely
with [open source
organizations](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/)
alongside mentors. Each writer works on an open source project chosen from the
organization's list of projects or proposed by the writer. The writers bring
their expertise to the projects’ documentation while at the same time learning
about open source and new technologies.

**Open Source Organizations**

Open Source Organizations across the globe like [Open source Community
Africa](https://medium.com/u/210312b4e59b) and
[OpenCollective](https://medium.com/u/a39eaca884ec) applies to join the program
and provides some project ideas based on their documentation needs, then work
with technical writers to build and improve their entire documentation system.
[Complete Organization list
here](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/)

**Mentors**

Members of each Open Source Organization like [Alanna
Irving](https://medium.com/u/dcd8e3da4363) take part in Season of Docs as
mentors for technical writers. Mentors introduce technical writers to their
community and help them to use the project’s tools and understand the product.
