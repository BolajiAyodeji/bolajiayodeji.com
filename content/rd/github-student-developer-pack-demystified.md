There’s no substitute for hands-on experience, but for most students, real-world
tools can be quite expensive. That’s why [GitHub](https://github.com/) created
the **GitHub Student Developer Pack** to give **students** **free access** to
the **best developer tools** in one place so they can **learn by doing**.

In this article, I’d take you through:

* What is GitHub Student Developer Pack
* Contents of the pack
* Terms and Conditions
* How to apply for the pack
* Expiration and renewals

Let’s roll :)

### Terms and Conditions

To be eligible for the GitHub Student Developer Pack, you must:

* Be currently enrolled in a degree or diploma granting course of study
* Have a verifiable school-issued email address or school documents that prove
your current student status
* Have a [GitHub user
account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)
* Be at least 13 years old

### How to apply for the pack

If you meet the above requirements, you can apply for the GitHub Student
Developer Pack, which includes offers and benefits from GitHub partners.

**[1]. Visit the application website**

* Go to [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/) and, in the top right,
click Join GitHub Education.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*U1gVH0ALuTfGG0zc.png)

* Under “Which best describes your academic status?”, select Student.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*VcckIjBRe5Z78Dk5.png)

**[2]. Verification process**

There are two ways to verify your student status, a verifiable school-issued
email address or school documents that prove your current student status e.g
(**Admission letter, Departmental receipts, Faculty letters, School grants
receipts and others)**

> Selecting a school-issued email address, if you have one, gives you the best
> chance of a speedy review. Although the second method takes a little more time,
it would still get verified. If you reside in Nigeria and attend a Federal or
State University, you would have to consider the second method otherwise you can
use the first.

* Select or add the email address you use for school.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*zUP1Iptj4mwf9MGP.png)

* Upload proof of your academic status if you do not have a school-issued email
address

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*i542b4wazxZ8J913.png)

> PDF files are not supported, and you cannot upload them as proof of academic
> status. Upload in image format (e.g .png, .jpg, .jpeg)

* Enter your school’s name.
* Describe how you plan to use GitHub.

> This is just to check if you truly know the worth of the pack. Briefly state
> what you need the pack for and how you would use it.

* **Verify your application details**, then click **Submit your information.**

> If your application is approved, you’ll receive a confirmation email.
> Applications are usually processed within a few days, but it may take longer
during peak times, such as during the start of a new semester. I got mine within
32 hours :)

### Expiration and renewals

Once your GitHub Student Developer Pack access expires, you may reapply if
you’re still eligible, although some of the tools are not renewable as some
GitHub partner offers cannot be renewed. For more information, see the [GitHub
Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) page.

To see when your free access to the GitHub Student Developer Pack expires, visit
your account’s [billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing).
